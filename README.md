# Boids screensaver for Windows

This repository contains `.scr` screensaver files for Windows.

- To install, download or clone this repository and go into `windows32` or `windows64`, depending on your OS architecture. Beware, this repository is about 500 megabytes.
- Then, right click the `.scr` file and click "install." It'll probably tell you that Windows doesn't trust the file. I can guarantee that the file doesn't have any malignant code. I cannot guarantee that it won't cause problems if your system is somehow broken or different.
- Make sure that the `.scr` file always stays with the folders it comes with--in particular, the `java`, `lib`, and `source` folders must be in the same directory as the `.scr` file. If you separate any of these, then the screensaver will fail.

*Note: If you already have the Java JRE installed, then you don't need the `java` folder. I simply included it so that you don't need to have JRE installed.*

Video explanation for installation coming soon!



This code was largely based off of Daniel Shiffman's [implementation](https://thecodingtrain.com/CodingChallenges/124-flocking-boids.html) of the Boid artificial life program. The [code](https://github.com/haschdl/processingscreensaver_windows) used to make the screensaver was made by Half Scheidl.
