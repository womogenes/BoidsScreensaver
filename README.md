# Boids screensaver for Windows

This repository contains `.scr` screensaver files for Windows.

- To install, download or clone this repository and go into `windows32` or `windows64`, depending on your OS architecture.
- Then, right click the `.scr` file and click "install." It'll probably tell you that Windows doesn't trust the file. I can guarantee that the file doesn't have any malignant code. I cannot guarantee that it won't cause problems if your system is somehow broken or different.

Video explanation coming soon!
